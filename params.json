  "body": "## Introduction\r\n\r\n**GetYourData.org** **is** **a website that makes it simple for citizens to get a copy of their personal data from companies and the government**. The project aims to create a platform that can be used in several European countries.\r\n\r\nCitizens of the European Union have a legal right to request a copy of the information and data about them that is held by organisations. For instance in Finland, this right is defined in [Henkilötietolaki](http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1999/19990523)  (for explanation of right [see here](http://www.tietosuoja.fi/fi/index/useinkysyttya/tarkastusoikeusjatiedonkorjaaminen.html)).\r\n\r\nAt present, few people exercise this right because the process of making personal data request can be complicated. One has to know how to craft the right text for the request, find contact details, manage correspondence, and do this without knowledge of previous experiences in dealing with particular organisations. A digital tool for making data requests can make them more accessible and usable for a wider range of purposes.\r\n\r\nThe type of data that can be accessed through requests include insurance and credit profiles, tax and medical records, list of transactions with companies, and the list of information used in bureacratic decisions  Making this information easier to reach for citizens can have a number of benefits. The service will help people ensure institutions have made decisions that affect them on the right grounds, answer to concerns about privacy, and make it easier for people to collect the documentation they need (for instance when applying for residence permits). Ultimately the service may also be part of an ecosystem of personal data management, in which individuals can manage and reuse data about themselves.\r\n\r\nFor the Finnish context the site will be run by Open Knowledge Finland ry. The project group has also participants in the United Kingdom and France that will run local versions of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Status of the project\r\n\r\nThe first version of the service is being developed during the summer and autumn in 2016, and is user tested in Finland. The service is likely to be publicly available later in the year.\r\n\r\nThe code for the service is published under open source license (MIT License), and is available at https://github.com/sakset/getyourdata.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Team\r\n\r\nGetYourData.org is being developed by a group of people based in Finland, the UK and France. The students joining the project would work most closely with people in Finland, who are associated with Open Knowledge Finland. The team on the client’s side has the following expertise:\r\n\r\nAnssi Mikola: Project coordination\r\n\r\nAntti Poikola: Project coordination, legal & MyData knowledge\r\n\r\nAleksi Knuutila: Back-end development and project management\r\n\r\nMarion Blatter: User experience\r\n\r\nMaxime Cordier: Data protection law\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contact information\r\n\r\nOpen Knowledge Finland is a registered not-for-profit association and part of the wider international Open Knowledge -network.
